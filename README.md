# Description

The game features 173 tracks in 34 sceneries and 25 vehicles.
Game modes include: Single Race, Tutorials, Championships, Challenges,
Multiplayer and Split Screen. Also present are Replays and Ghost mode.

The Track Editor allows creating and modifying tracks.
Both run on GNU/Linux and Windows.

The game aims at a rally style of driving (like in Richard Burns Rally),
with possible stunt elements (jumps, loops, pipes)
and uses a 3D spline generated road.

For a full list of features, check our [Wiki](http://stuntrally.tuxfamily.org/wiki/doku.php?id=features).

The minimum hardware is:
- CPU: with 2 cores, above 2.0GHz,
- GPU: GeForce 9600 GT or Radeon HD 3870,
