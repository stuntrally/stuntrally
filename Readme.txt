Description

The game features 146 tracks in 26 sceneries and 19 cars + 4 vehicles.
Game modes include: Single Race, Tutorials, Championships, Challenges,
Multiplayer and Split Screen. Also Replays and Ghost drive are present.

The Track Editor allows creating and modifying tracks.
Both run on GNU/Linux and Windows.

The game aims at a rally style of driving (like in Richard Burns Rally),
with possible stunt elements (jumps, loops, pipes)
and uses a 3D spline generated road.

Hardware requirements

The minimum hardware is:
 CPU: with 2 cores, above 2.0GHz,
 GPU: GeForce 9600 GT or Radeon HD 3870,
with Shader Model 3.0 supported and 256 MB GPU RAM (512 on higher settings).

A good GPU for smooth play at Higher preset is GTX 560 Ti (no effects).
Integrated GPUs or laptops don't handle the game well or at all.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running

In game Esc/Tab key shows/hides Options.

At first in Options window (tab Screen) adjust resolution and
pick settings preset according to your GPU.
Restart after changing preset.

Keys used in game can be seen in Options tab [Input].
If you want to reassign keys, or have a game controller
go to tab [Input] to configure it and test range.

By default, drive with Arrow keys, use Backspace to rewind after crashes.
Change cameras with C/X (with shift for main cameras only).
Cameras can be adjusted in game, by mouse - move mouse to see actions.

All settings and logs are saved to user folder (check Wiki page [Paths]).
If you have problems running, read Wiki page [Running].
If it doesn't help, report on IRC or make an issue on Forum [SR Bugs & Help]
(if a similar topic doesn't exist). Be sure to attach your log files.

Editor

In editor, F1 key shows/hides Options,
press Ctrl-F1 to read what can be edited and how.
Tab key switches between Camera/Edit mode.
There isn't (and won't be) an undo function -
hit F5 to reload last track state, and F4 to save it (often).
After each save, track can be tested in game.

There is an Editor Tutorial Wiki page (link at top)
with videos: 14 chapters, 64 minutes total.

Have fun !
