    Description

The game features 172 tracks in 34 sceneries and 25 vehicles.
Game modes include: Single Race, Tutorials, Championships, Challenges,
Multiplayer and Split Screen. Also Replays and Ghost drive are present.

The Track Editor allows creating and modifying tracks.

The game aims at a rally style of driving (like in Richard Burns Rally),
with possible stunt elements (jumps, loops, pipes)
and uses a 3D spline generated road.
